# TCCM
PEG tutorial on coarse-graining

Demo simulations for coarse grained polymer models using LAMMPS.

usage

Open the ipynb file in Google Colab and run all cells. The notebook is self-contained in that it automatically generates all scripts and auxiliary files in the Colab runtime.

warning

These demos use a third-party build of the LAMMPS package that is distributed via the Python package index. Package info available via https://pypi.org/project/lammps/ . The build repository can be found at https://github.com/njzjz/lammps-wheel . Version 2024.8.29.1.0 of this package appears to be legitimate but the legitimacy of later releases cannot be guaranteed because the LAMMPS developers are not involved in the distribution of the package. Use outside of Colab at your own risk.
